# PlotTrace — Chapter‑Aware RAG for Books

An AI-powered reading companion that creates chapter-specific summaries and answers questions about your books using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.

## ✨ Features
- Chapter-aware chunking for long-form books (PDF/EPUB/TXT).
- Vector-based retrieval to fetch the most relevant passages per query.
- Summarization that respects chapter boundaries and structure.
- Q&A over chapters, with citations to source chunks.
- Built initially as a Jupyter notebook for quick iteration; exported here as a Python script for GitHub.

## 📁 Repository Structure
```text
├── novel_plottrace.ipynb        # Original notebook
├── plottrace_commented.py       # Cleaned, linearized script extracted from the notebook
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies (heuristic)
└── README.md                    # You are here
```

## ⚙️ Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If this project uses APIs (e.g., OpenAI), set environment variables as needed:
```bash
# Example:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## 🚀 Quickstart
### Option A: Run the Notebook
1. Launch Jupyter and open `novel_plottrace.ipynb`.
2. Follow the cells top-to-bottom. Add your API keys as needed.

### Option B: Run the Python Script
```bash
python plottrace_commented.py
```
_Tip: Consider refactoring the script into modules (e.g., `ingest/`, `retrieval/`, `ui/`) if you plan to extend it._

## 🧠 How It Works (High Level)
1. **Ingest**: Load book files (PDF/EPUB/TXT), normalize text, and detect chapters.
2. **Chunk**: Split text into semantically meaningful chunks, keeping chapter boundaries in mind.
3. **Embed**: Generate vector embeddings for the chunks (e.g., sentence-transformers or OpenAI embeddings).
4. **Index**: Store embeddings in a vector index (e.g., FAISS) for fast similarity search.
5. **Retrieve**: For a query, fetch the top-k relevant chunks.
6. **Generate**: Feed retrieved chunks into an LLM to summarize or answer questions, with citations.

## 🧪 Testing Tips
- Start with a short book or a few chapters to validate the pipeline.
- Verify chunk boundaries and ensure summaries are chapter-scoped.
- Compare different embedding models and values of `k` for retrieval quality.

## 📌 Roadmap Ideas
- CLI with subcommands: `ingest`, `summarize`, `ask`
- Export chapter summaries to Markdown with citations
- Simple Streamlit/Gradio UI to browse chapters and ask questions
- Optional persistence: save embeddings/index to disk
